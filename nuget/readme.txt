To use:
1. Copy over any additional code you have added to the original UITest template generated AppInitializer.cs file.
2. Remove current AppInitializer.cs file, if present.
3. Rename AppInitializer.txt to AppInitializer.cs
4. Ensure page objects inherit from BasePage
5. Ensure test classes inherit from AbstractSetup
